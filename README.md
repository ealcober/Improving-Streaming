# Improving Streaming
Code based on (1) Rudrich SimpleCompressor and (2) Alermi pd-HighPass for academic research looking for relations between compression and equalization and voice intelligibillity.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a digital audio processor, based on traditional signal enhancement tools. We will broadcast voice through it, and variations detected on voice intelligibility will be studied, looking for relations within different configuration parameters applied.

With this, I want to shed a little light on the **mystery of compression and equalization tools** :wink:

All source information can be found on *References* section.
